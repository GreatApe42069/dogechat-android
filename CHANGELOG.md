## [0.9.6] - 2025-09-17
This release introduces initial Dogecoin wallet support and syncs with upstream changes through permissionlesstech/bitchat-android commit 1178fc254a81e660fde509dbc9130f4c4940be68.

### Added
- Dogecoin wallet (alpha)
  - Wallet screen and navigation from ChatHeader.
  - DNS seed peer discovery for Dogecoin; connects to peers without Tor.
  - Initial transaction fetch logic and detailed SPV logs for troubleshooting.
  - WIF import support and private key display/backup action.
  - Triple-tap emergency wallet data wipe from header for quick reset.
  - About screen controls for starting the SPV node (exposed entry point for wallet/SPV controls).
- Tor separation for wallet
  - Early support to start wallet/SPV connectivity separately from main app Tor controls; added extensive logging to aid validation.

### Changed
- UI/Theming
  - Wrapped wallet UI in Doge theme and refined wallet colors for visual consistency.
  - Minor UI tweaks to resolve button clashes and improve layout on the Wallet screen.
- About sheet
  - Cleaned up duplicated network section and updated copy to reflect wallet/SPV sections and controls.
- Dependencies
  - Updated Dogecoin/Bitcoin libraries (dogecoinj/bitcoinj jars) during development.
  - Switched back to libdohj snapshot 16 to stabilize builds due to upstream dogecoinj repo build gaps.
- Codebase hygiene
  - Removed unnecessary/obsolete files and simplified routing to reduce duplication.

### Fixed
- Wallet
  - Reliability improvements for wallet wipe and WIF import flows.
  - Resolved wallet UI button overlap and click handling issues.
- App UI
  - Fixed chat text display regressions encountered during wallet integration.
  - Corrected AboutSheet navigation from header and resolved duplicate network section.
- Networking
  - Fixed DNS seed connection flow for Dogecoin when Tor is disabled; peers now connect via DNS seeds as expected.

### Upstream sync
- Merged upstream through permissionlesstech/bitchat-android commit `1178fc254a81e660fde509dbc9130f4c4940be68`:
  - ‚Äúremove the noise handshake if peer goes offline‚Äù (#435)
- Previous upstream Tor-related improvements listed in 0.9.5 were already incorporated.

### Known limitations
- Tor-backed SPV for the wallet is experimental. Earlier iterations noted the SPV node not starting via Tor; this release separates wallet Tor management and adds detailed logs, but further validation across devices/networks is recommended.

### Notes for testers
- This is an alpha wallet integration. Back up any keys you import or generate. Use test funds first.
- Try both connectivity modes:
  - Without Tor: confirm DNS seed discovery and peer connections.
  - With wallet Tor separation: verify SPV startup and sync behavior.
- Validate WIF import/export, private key backup action, and emergency wipe gesture.
